README

The scripts in this directory should be run from the project root:

$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/coreos/etcd
$ tests/fixtures/v1/complete.1.sh

Scripts with numbers should be run in separate terminal windows (in order):

$ tests/fixtures/v1/complete.1.sh
$ tests/fixtures/v1/complete.2.sh
$ tests/fixtures/v1/complete.3.sh
$ tests/fixtures/v1/complete.4.sh

The resulting server state data can be found in tmp/node0.
